Let’s say hypothetically you want me to feed you! Ok so you want ME to spend MY hard earned money just so you can eat. That’s in fact communism! Now I love my country which means that I don’t support communism. Of course you might think that it’s MY responsibility as a parent to give you food. But communists also feed their children and I would NEVER do something that communists do as well. Therefore I won’t feed you and I will stop breathing because with my vast intellect I’ve figured it out that communists also breathe just like us!

There are 5 films that occurs in Disneys Cars universe, but it none of them address the fact that a car genocide happened in which Car Hitler exterminated 6 million Car Jews during Car World War II. It is very easy to prove that Car Hitler is real, using canonical Cars lore. The general line of thought is something like this: The Cars-verse includes a World War II�era Jeep named Sarge, who explicitly references events like the Battle of the Bulge. In the direct-to-DVD film Planes (made by Disney but not Pixar), there is an actual WWII flashback in which the plane Skipper recalls losing his entire squadron in the Pacific Theater. Assuming that Car WWII occurred, and that it contains the same contours as the actual WWII, we can assume that there were Car Axis powers, and thus a Car Hitler.
